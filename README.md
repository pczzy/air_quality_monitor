## GP2Y1010AU0F Dust Sensor
GP2Y1010AU0F is a dust sensor by optical sensing system. 
An infrared emitting diode (IRED) and an phototran-sistor are diagonally arranged into this device.
It detects the reflected light of dust in air.
Especially, it is effective to detect very fine particle like the cigarette smoke. 
In addition it can distinguish smoke from house dust by pulse pattern of output voltage
