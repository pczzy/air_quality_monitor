Monitor Air Pollution especially  small particles. There are heavly small particles pollution in china and  the consentration of small particles will exceed 1000ug/m3 when serious pollution.


## GP2Y1010AU0F Dust Sensor
GP2Y1010AU0F is a dust sensor by optical sensing system. 
An infrared emitting diode (IRED) and an phototran-sistor are diagonally arranged into this device.
It detects the reflected light of dust in air.
Especially, it is effective to detect very fine particle like the cigarette smoke. 
In addition it can distinguish smoke from house dust by pulse pattern of output voltage
